# Customer Cohort Analysis

This project focuses on customer cohort analysis to gain insights into customer behavior and track their interactions with a business over time. The analysis and modeling are performed using SQL, and the results are visualized through a dashboard created on Tableau Public.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of customer data that includes information such as customer IDs, purchase dates, transaction amounts, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is stored in a SQL database and used to perform cohort analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run the SQL queries and reproduce the customer cohort analysis, you need the following prerequisites:

- Access to a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- SQL client or IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver)

To view and interact with the Tableau dashboard, you need:

- Access to Tableau Public (a free Tableau software version)
- Tableau Desktop (optional, if you want to modify the dashboard)

## Usage

### SQL Analysis

1. Connect to your SQL database using the SQL client or IDE of your choice.

2. Open the SQL script file provided in this repository (e.g., `cohort-analysis.sql`).

3. Execute the SQL queries in the script file sequentially to perform the customer cohort analysis.

### Tableau Dashboard

1. Open Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.

2. Connect to the SQL database where the analysis results are stored.

3. Import the necessary tables or views from the database to Tableau.

4. Create visualizations and design the dashboard using the imported data.

5. Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public (if using Tableau Desktop) or save it locally.

6. Optionally, modify the dashboard layout, add interactivity, and customize the visualizations as desired.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- `customer-cohort-analysis.sql`: SQL script file containing the queries for performing customer cohort analysis.

- `dashboard.twb`: Tableau workbook file containing the dashboard design and visualizations.

- `data`: Directory that may contain additional files or scripts related to data preprocessing or SQL database setup.

## Dashboard Visualization

The Tableau dashboard provides visualizations and insights based on the customer cohort analysis. It may include:

- Cohort analysis by cohort groups and time periods, showcasing metrics such as customer retention, average order value, and customer lifetime value.

- Cohort retention heatmap or line chart to visualize the retention rates across different cohorts and periods.

- Time-based analysis of customer behavior and trends, including purchase frequency, revenue, and other relevant metrics.

- Drill-down or filter options to explore specific cohorts or time periods in more detail.
